###### Usage Example

```
# Graph creation and analysis
g = Graph(directed=True, weighted=True)
for i in range(6):
    g.add_vertex(i)
g.add_edge(0, 1, 5)
g.add_edge(0, 2, 3)
# ... more edges ...

# Run Dijkstra's algorithm
distances, predecessors = dijkstra(g, 0)
for vertex, distance in distances.items():
    path = reconstruct_shortest_path(0, vertex, predecessors)
    print(f"Shortest path to {vertex}: {path} with distance {distance}")

# Dynamic programming example
values = [60, 100, 120]
weights = [10, 20, 30]
capacity = 50
max_value, selected_items = knapsack_01_with_solution(values, weights, capacity)
```
