##### Kosmos (κόσμος) is a fascinating ancient Greek concept with rich philosophical implications that make it particularly apt for a collection of algorithms.

In ancient Greek thought, Kosmos originally meant "order" or "arrangement" but evolved to represent the entire universe as an ordered, harmonious system. The Greeks were among the first to view the universe not as chaotic or arbitrary, but as governed by underlying patterns, proportions, and mathematical principles.
The Pythagoreans were particularly influential in developing this concept, believing that mathematical relationships underlay the order of the universe. They saw numbers as the key to understanding reality, similar to how algorithms use mathematical procedures to solve problems.
For the philosopher Plato, the Kosmos was a perfect and beautiful living entity created by a divine craftsman (the Demiurge) according to eternal mathematical principles. This mirrors how algorithms represent orderly procedures designed to achieve specific goals efficiently.
Aristotle viewed the Kosmos as a hierarchical system where everything has its proper place and purpose - similar to how algorithms are structured procedures with defined steps leading to specific outcomes.
The Stoics later expanded on this concept, seeing the Kosmos as a rationally ordered whole governed by divine reason (Logos) - a perspective that parallels how algorithms embody logical reasoning to solve problems.
Using "Kosmos" as a folder name for algorithms suggests that your collection represents not just procedures, but a harmonious system of ordered knowledge that reflects the underlying patterns of reality - methods that bring order to complexity, just as the ancient Greeks believed the universe itself was ordered by mathematical principles.
