## Study Techniques

### For Each Algorithm:
1. **Understand the Concept:**
   - Read the theory and watch visualizations
   - Draw the algorithm execution by hand for small examples

2. **Master the Implementation:**
   - Write the code from scratch without looking at references
   - Test with various inputs including edge cases
   - Optimize your implementation

3. **Analyze Applications:**
   - Study where the algorithm is used in real systems
   - Consider modifications for special cases

### Weekly Review Process:
1. **Revisit Each Algorithm:**
   - Re-implement core algorithms without references
   - Create flashcards for key concepts

2. **Challenge Yourself:**
   - Solve problems that combine multiple algorithms
   - Explain algorithms to someone else (or pretend to)

3. **Reflection:**
   - Document what was difficult and what clicked
   - Create a personal cheat sheet with your own insights

## Resources

### Visualization Tools:
- Use the provided visualization module to see algorithms in action
- Supplement with online tools like VisuAlgo, Algorithm Visualizer

### Problem Sources:
- LeetCode for practical algorithm problems
- HackerRank for implementation practice
- Codeforces for competitive programming challenges

### Books:
- "Introduction to Algorithms" by CLRS for theoretical foundations
- "Algorithms" by Sedgewick for practical implementations
- "Algorithm Design Manual" by Skiena for real-world applications

## Assessment Strategy

### Weekly Self-Assessment:
- Implement 1-2 algorithms from memory
- Solve 3-5 problems that apply the week's algorithms
- Explain an algorithm to a peer or record yourself explaining it

### Mid-Phase Assessments:
- Take a timed test implementing 3 randomly selected algorithms
- Solve a complex problem that requires multiple algorithm types
- Create your own visualization or explanation for one algorithm

### Final Assessment:
- Complete a project that integrates multiple algorithm types
- Perform code reviews on your earlier implementations
- Create a personalized algorithm toolkit with your optimized implementations

Remember: Understanding the "why" behind algorithms is as important as knowing the "how" of implementation. Focus on building intuition for when and why to apply each algorithm.
